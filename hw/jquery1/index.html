    <section id="step1">
      <img height="500" src="images/runwayshow.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Go to the Vogue Runway website and pay attention to the trends in each designer's collection. Once you've noted what is popular, write them down.</p>

    <p>You know how you make a grocery list before a shopping trip? It's the same when you shop for clothes! Write down whether you want to look for a specific style of pants or jacket to add to your closet--or whether you're missing an essential piece.</p>
  </section>

    <section id="step3">
      <img height="500" src="images/thrifting.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Once you get to the thrift store, take out your handy dandy notebook and scan what you wrote down. Then keep what you read, in mind and search for that in the store!</p>

    <section id="step4">
      <img height="500" src="images/jeans.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Make sure that the piece you are getting is in good condition and isn't totally worn out or broken to the point where you can no longer fix it.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="step5">
      <img height="500" src="images/fitting.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Head over to the fitting room, if there is one, to avoid picking up items that don't fit.</p>
