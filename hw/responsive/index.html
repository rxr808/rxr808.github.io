      <p>Next up in my favorites was Margiela, Loewe, Lemaire, Undercover and Jacquemus with tones of neutrals like tan, olive and navy. Their clothing was minimal and very much for la vie quotidien. Pantsuits and a touch of exaggeration walked down the runway with puffed up tops like in the Victorian era and oversized coats that make the garments stand out. Some pieces I would dare describe as effortless and subdued maximalism with prints that stand out but aren’t too loud. Perfect for the person who wants to experiment with their style but isn’t quite ready to make a jump. Lemaire’s show was very diverse, it had a lot of people of color as well as elder models. Diversity is always important and we’re also not used to seeing elder models walk down the runway—so the message they conveyed with this show was definitely empowering; challenging society’s idea of beauty. And it being this youthful and fair dynamic.
