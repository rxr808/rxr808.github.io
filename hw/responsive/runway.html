                <p>Kicking off the third fashion week of the month, Jacquemus debuted his show around 5 PM Parisian time. John Galliano and Jacquemus have a French prairie aesthetic that I fell in love wiht and decided to showcase both of their collections side by side. Let’s begin with the atmosphere and set design created by Bureau Betak: two words. Murano, Italy. It was a reimagined Murano, Italy with Jacquemus’ family fruit and vegetables mini market shop. Mixing Jacquemus’ familiarity with the countryside of the south of France and the countryside of Italy, it was like an ethereal modern version of International Gothic style come to life. With exaggerating accessories, both grandiose and minuscule—Jacquemus’ love of nature and ornamental splendor shines through in this show. The clothing also spoke for themselves. Matching the setting and the accessories, Jacquemus never fails to bring the warm countryside climate to any season of the year. Think spring/summer but make it fall/winter!
