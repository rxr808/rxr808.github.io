          <img src="images/IMG_0369.jpg" alt="">
          <p>I walked through the wonderful streets of Paris in the summer of 2018. It felt like New York, but older, bigger and filled with endless history. One place you must visit in Paris if you go is Le Marais. It's filled with artists creating their art on the street!  </p>

          <h2 class="sectiontitle">Rome, Italy</h2>

          <img src="images/IMG_2698.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Walking around one of the oldest cities, I felt like I was a part of history. I instantly transported to a different era. The architecture was wonderful. I'd recommend going to the colosseum in Rome!</p>

          <h2 class="sectiontitle">Burano, Venice, Italy</h2>
          <img src="images/IMG_1411.jpg" alt="">
          <p>In the islands of Venice, Italy lies a colorful one at best. With the gorgeous vibrant colors with flowers draping over the balcony, you're sure to fall in love. One thing you absolutely must do when you're in Venice is to travel to the sister island of Burano--named Murano--and watch the process of glassblowing. Stunning! </p>

          <h2 class="sectiontitle">Cinque Terre, Italy</h2>
          <img src="images/IMG_2614.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Cinque Terre was breathtaking. It was a wonderful concotion of city, ocean, terrain and sunbathers! You can see locals hanging their clothes to dry on their balcony while people-watching. When in Cinque Terre, you must try the seafood in any restaurant!</p>

          <h2 class="sectiontitle">Cinque Terre, Italy</h2>
          <img src="images/IMG_2613.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The oceanic aspect of Cinque Terre is quite spectacular. It is colorful, but very distinct from Venice--instead of bright colors, they are a bit more Earth toned but still lively and rich. Another place you cannot miss in Cinque Terre is the beach! You have to sunbathe like a local!</p>
